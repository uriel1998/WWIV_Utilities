	Bug reports/suggestions/support should be sent to:

	Please be specific in describing your problem, and remember, if
	I can't reproduce it, I can't fix it.

4.  To-do list

	Figure out a way to "fake" a bbslist.0.  Low priority, though -
        they are by definition small enough to maintain flinks by hand.

5.  Thanks (all new! Wow!)

	Frank Reid - For his flinkchk program.  Saved me *MUCH* time.
	My mom - for helping me when I got stuck with an array problem
	D-Warz and Ninja - For offering suggestions and keeping the
	  faith in trying to get this sucker running.

6. History:

(prior to merging, N denotes NetCommander release, G GLOBALFlink)

v4.1 Added fix to allow unregistered servers to be Gflinked.  This works
      by giving servers w/o a valid registration number a registration
      number of 12111973 - longer than any regnum, but well within the
      limits of a long variable. - 6 Mar 2000

v4.0  Improved speed (4 seconds less on my 486/100) and far less disk I/O
      Improved checking routines for GFLINK
      Can use GFLINK routines with *ANY* network with a bbslist.0
      Provides a list of all potential Flinks, including levels of confidence
	and whether or not they are "marked flinkable".
      FLINK.INI sorted by either nodes or networks
      Allows you to just "check" GFLINK without altering network data
      Better cleanup and uninstall routines
      Smaller size and memory footprint
      No separate INI file
      Requires Autocon! version .96B and above (if you use Autocon! at all).
      Cap of 20 networks and 250 nodes in Primenet (though easily changeable
	in the source!)
      Sysop-definable utilities removed - AutoSend /REMOVE automatically run
	if it exists in the BBS directory.
      -29 Feb 2000

v3.6 Added the "EXACT_MATCH" tag for riskier Gflink matching

v3.5 Release of source code.
     Changed modifier to '`' for detecting Flinkable nodes.
     Streamlined uninstall procedure for ease-of-use.
	- 21 Jul 1999

v3.00-b2 Support "new" Autocon, different spawn routines - 09 Dec 1997

v3.00-b1  GLOBALFlink dependent on NetCommander
       File sharing support added
       INI support added
       Gives up a decent number of timeslices as it cycles through
       Fewer open files at one time
       A bunch more small tweaks

Gv1.10 Actually creates a FLINK.INI (whoops!)
       Adds '99' to BBSLIST.0 correctly (the ~line sometimes threw it)
       Skips networks without BBSLIST.0
       Adds = identifier to CALLOUT.NET
       Reads what BBSLISTs to use according to BBSLIST.0, not dir search
       Compares CALLOUT.NET entries by NUMBER, not string comparison
       Additional "dummychecking" throughout code
       Stop looking through lists even AFTER flink found
	- 26 August 1997

Nv2.00 Bugfix due to system() calls instead of spawn() calls.  No memory
       errors.  Added configuration utility and writing NETCMDR.CFG
       in binary mode instead of text-editable NETCMDR.INI mode. 26 Jun 97

Nv1.51 Bugfix with stream closures, ensured that locks were due to 20/0
       instead of NetCommander.  Added diagnostic mode and simple mode.
       22 Jun 97

Nv1.5  Discovery of two easy ways to make v1.0 infinitely loop - fixed.
       Hard-coded Autocon! and GLOBALFlink calls into NetCommander, with
       NET3 calls to ALL networks after GLOBALFlink runs - but only with
       feedback on the original network.  Added BBS path detection. 15 Jun 97

Nv1.00 Initial inception/idea of NetCommander while messing with GLOBALFlink
       code.  Wrote it while taking a break from GLOBALFlink.  =) 12 Jun 97

Gv1.01 Pre-emptive fix to a potential problem with flinks over non-filenet 
       systems, remove neccessity to damn near delete flink.ini before 
       installing. - 22 May 1997

Gv1.00 Initial creation of GLOBALFlink.  Automatically rewrites FLINK.INI,
       searches out networks on its own, creates alternate CONNECT.99 in
       NON-Filenet directories to mess with regular network routing as
       little as possible, updates CALLOUT.NET, BBSLIST.0.
