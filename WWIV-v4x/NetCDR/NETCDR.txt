		THE DOWN AND DIRTY SETUP

(If upgrading from 4.0 to 4.1, just overwrite the NETWORK3.EXE from
4.0 with the one in this archive.)

1. Back up your network data, including FLINK.INI

2. Unzip this archive into a temporary directory

3. If you've never installed GFLINK/NETCOMMANDER before:
   a. If you intend to use GFLINK, make sure you have an installed
      (read: unzipped) copy of FLINK8.  Make sure you have a working
      WWIV BBS with net3x installed.
   b. Copy the net3x version of NETWORK3.EXE to NET3.EXE.
   c. Overwrite the NETWORK3.EXE with the one in this
      archive.  Please make sure that the net3x version
      of NETWORK3.EXE still exists as NET3.EXE!
   d. Execute NETWORK3.EXE without any switches.
   e. Set PRIMENET in WWIV.INI (scroll to the bottom, it's been
      added) to the network you wish to flink data over - probably
      Filenet.
   f. Search for "INI SETTINGS" in this document to find out what
      the rest of them do.  (Hint: Changing GFLINK and AUTOCON to
      "YES" and CHECKONLY to "NO" will probably set you straight.)

4. If *UPGRADING* from an earlier version:
   a. Delete GFLINK.EXE and NETCDR.INI from your BBS directory.
   b. Overwrite the NETWORK3.EXE with the one in this
      archive.  Please make sure that the net3x version
      of NETWORK3.EXE still exists as NET3.EXE!
   c. Execute NETWORK3.EXE without any switches.
   d. Set PRIMENET in WWIV.INI (scroll to the bottom, it's been
      added) to the network you wish to flink data over - probably
      Filenet.
   e. Execute NETWORK3 -UNINSTALL (to remove old GFLINK entries).
   f. Search for "INI SETTINGS" in this document to find out what
      the rest of them do.  (Hint: Changing GFLINK and AUTOCON to
      "YES" and CHECKONLY to "NO" will probably set you straight.)

*************************************************************

1. What *is* this program?

NetCommander is an enhancement of NETWORK3.EXE for WWIV.  When
network3 is called, instead of simply doing network analysis,
NetCommander can also run the GLOBALFlink routines, Autocon!,
and AutoSend to ensure that your network files are all up to
date.

This version of NetCommander incorporates the GLOBALFlink code in one
executable.  GLOBALFlink has two primary purposes - to ensure speedy
transmission of network data in NON-PPP-using networks (this is already
achieved inside those networks by the use of Autocon! by CellarSoft) and
to further reduce/destroy network hubs and server's workloads.  I mean,
do *you* really want to keep track of a whole bunch of people's Flinks?

GFLINK works in conjunction with the function of Autocon!, but does
not require its use to function.  As bennies, it maintains all the
connections it's made - deleting when neccessary, etc.  As further
bennies, think of how easy it'll be to get a new node flinked!

2. What's new?

Quite a few things, actually.

* Improved speed (4 seconds less on my 486/100) and far less disk I/O
* Improved checking routines for GFLINK
* Can use GFLINK routines with *ANY* network with a bbslist.0
* Provides a list of all potential Flinks, including levels of confidence
  and whether or not they are "marked flinkable".
* FLINK.INI sorted by either nodes or networks
* Allows you to just "check" GFLINK without altering network data
* Better cleanup and uninstall routines
* Smaller size and memory footprint
* No separate INI file
* Requires Autocon! version .96B and above (if you use Autocon!, that is).
* Cap of 20 networks and 250 nodes in Primenet (though easily changeable
  in the source!)
* Sysop-definable utilities removed - AutoSend /REMOVE automatically run
  if it exists in the BBS directory.

3. What are the possible commandline switches?

If you wish to do a network analysis of all WWIV-style networks
(and get feedback from all of them), use the -D switch, like so:

NETWORK3 -D

If you wish to do a network analysis (and get feedback) on any
network by name, type the name of the network (caps don't matter)
as shown below:

good commandlines                  bad commandlines
NETWORK3 -filenet                  NETWORK3 -filesnet
NETWORK3 -icEnEt                   NETWORK3 -IceNett

You can also type only part of the network name.  NetCommander will
perform network analysis (and send feedback) on *EVERY* network that
matches.  So that "NETWORK3 -ww" would analyze and send feedback on
WWIVnet and WWIVlink.

The '-' switch character is important to include for this feature.

You can uninstall the GlobalFlink portions at any time by simply typing

NETWORK3 -UNINSTALL

4. What are the possible settings in WWIV.INI?

NetCommander automatically creates the [NETCDR] section at the end of
WWIV.INI if it doesn't already exist.  In it are these INI SETTINGS:

[NETCDR]
;inserted by NetCommander v4.0
; YES or NO - whether or not to run the GLOBALFlink routines
GFLINK=YES
; Only match nodes who have the ` identifier in BBSLIST.  See Errata
; about this.
MARKED_ONLY=YES
; Should we run AutoCon? YES or NO
; To use the -M switch, use "YES,MAIL"
; To use the -N switch, use "YES,NEWS"
AUTOCON=YES,NEWS
; If set to "YES", will only produce BIGFLINK.DAT in the main BBS
; directory.
CHECKONLY=NO
; How to sort FLINK.INI  NODE or NETWORK
SORT=NODE
; The name of your network to flink messages TO.
; DO NOT SWITCH THIS BACK AND FORTH WITHOUT USING THE UNINSTALL SWITCH
; BETWEEN CHANGES.  'nuff said.
PRIMENET=FILENET

5. How do the GFLINK routines work?

The GFLINK routines clean up after themselves at the start of each run.

All nodes - up to 250 - are read from the sysop-defined "primenet".
The first two words of the BBS name, phone number, and registration
number are snagged.  Then the other WWIV-style networks are read, and
the nodes are compared.  Comparison is "scored" as follows:

Matching registration number = 2 points
Matching phone number = 1 point
Matching name = 1 point

If three points or more are achieved, a match is considered found.  This
seems to be the best balance due to differences in node numbers and
names between networks.  These are then compared to entries in FLINK.INI
to ensure we're not making a duplicate entry.  It will recognize a
reverse entry as a duplicate - that is, if it's about to add
"Whoopnet 1 CrAzYnEt 5", it will consider "crazynet 5 whoopnet 1" to
be a duplicate.  If it does not find a duplicate, it's added with
the distinctive AaAaAaAa style of capitalization for the primenet.
Then it is compared to anything in the appropriate CALLOUT.NET.  If
there's already an entry there, it doesn't add it to CALLOUT.NET or
CONNECT.99 (the idea being that you've already got a connect to them
and just forgot to add the flink).  Otherwise, well, it does.  =)
CALLOUT.NET entries have the distinctive _ identifier.  While it's
doing this, it adds the entry to BIGFLINK.DAT along with the
"confidence" and whether or not it is "marked flinkable".  The
confidence is the score it recieved when checking - it should be only
3 or 4.

6. Why should I be using the GFLINK utilies?

It should be noted that I use Filenet as an example throughout because
it's how I Flink my data.  It's also very PPP-oriented, which (when
combined with Autocon!) makes a vast majority of the nodes only one
hop away - an ideal situation for GFLINK.

First of all, even if you're NOT using GFLINK, it's easy to be
a *recieving* node.  If you have DE555.EXE in your Filenet (or main
BBS directory) you are *DONE* - all you need to do is to have your
node "marked flinkable" with the ` identifier in the Filenet BBSlist.

Consider - your average Filenet subboard, you may have a 0-3 day
turnaround - but you still have the old 3-7 day turnaround with
other WWIV networks - even though many of the servers are now a
part of Filenet and the PPP project.  Why?  Let's examine -

I (@207F) am subscribed to a sub hosted by (fictional) @69.BooNet
which has netval turned on. Currently I'm flinking all my non-filenet
traffic through, say, Frank (@1160F), so the path would look like this:

207F --- 120F
	 ???B --- additional boonet hubs --- 69B
	 ^^^^
this is the old flink method here...

Now, let's say that @69.BooNet has joined Filenet - but I haven't
been paying attention (and really, who watches the BBSlists like
football stats?).  All of a sudden, after the next time I run
GLOBALFlink, my routing for that subboard is:

207F --- 69F
	 69B

Marked difference, eh?  Further, it dramatically increases the number
of BBSes that are only one hop away - minimizing the damage that one
BBS can cause to network traffic if it goes down or has problems, since
you're connecting nearly directly with far more nodes.  It also gives
you more connects WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT FOR AN UPDATE.  Consider the
following table, generated 23 Feb 2000.

		       Average Hops (Total BBSes 1 Hop Away)
	Network   Without GFLINK | With Gflink   |  With Gflink "ALL"
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	Icenet        3.69(2)    |    2.77       |   1.79(48)
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	WWIVlink      3.12(1)	 |    2.87       |   2.01(29)
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	WWIVnet       3.75(2)	 |    3.15       |   2.26(61)
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	TFAlink       2.85(1)	 |    2.67       |    2.22(11)
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	Terranet      3.02(1)	 |    2.86       |    1.89(42)
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	GLOBALnet     2.22(3)	 |    2.19       |    1.44(20)
	-------------------------------------------------------------

The "ALL" column reflects what could happen if all Filenet BBSes had
the ` identifier.  Remember, all *they* have to do is to have one file
in their Filenet or main BBS directory to recieve Flinked packets.
Nothing else.

7. Errata

The options that most people might want to change that are currently
hardcoded (number of networks, max number of nodes, and what utilities
are run) are commented in the source.  Check the top of NETWORK3.C for
keywords to search for.  I actually commented the code as I rewrote it
(yes, ALL of it - except for the parts I didn't).

Frank Reid has written a "Flink Checker".  Some of the matches that
GFLINK makes his program currently thinks are bad.  Just keep this in
mind.  His program was quite helpful in finding areas that *I* made
mistakes - so don't think I'm bashing his efforts.  It cut the double-
checking time down *IMMENSELY*, and helped identify some areas where I
needed to work on the code herein.

Regarding the MARKED_ONLY switch.  Well.  Um, I put it in there so you
could see for yourself what a difference it makes - though you can also
see that in BIGFLINK.DAT.  Nearly every system in Filenet should have
DE555.EXE in their Filenet directory, y'know... but I wouldn't want to
send Flinked traffic to the one who didn't.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I
leave mine set to "YES".
