	Unfortunately, we used it to eat dinner on after our regular

	and <TR> fields.  Sorry.

1.  Introduction

	You run a Filenet BBS.  You maintain filelists.  NFT used to maintain
	them for you.  Now it thinks they're all yet to be born.  Whatever 
	shall you do?

	Well, beside hooking me up with that gorgeous woman.

	Oh, that's *NOT* a woman.  Um.  Nevermind.

	Right - you're going to use FTS'er.  It's designed to be used as a 
	daily event to keep your FTS (and .DIR files, which NFT uses) current
	and neat and clean.  Though I can't make any promises about them 
	brushing their teeth.

Hardware/Software Requirements

	A PC.
	A working FTS network setup (e.g. - Filenet)

2.  Setup (etupsay! etupsay!)

	From the commandline (or batch file):

	FTSER [path] -<a[age]/o[age]/m>

	Use only one switch at a time. Things in [] are mandatory, <> are
	optional.  Default is only purging lists from non-existent nodes.
	It will also purge the dirfile.  

	Omitting all these switches will get you the following help:

þ Fts'er v1.0 - A UrielSoft Product
í Usage is FTSER [path] -<a[age]/o[age]/m>
í [path] is the DOS path for Filenet, withOUT trailing backslash.
í Switches: 
í -a = Request lists older than [age] and missing lists
í -o = Request lists older than [age]
í -m = Request missing lists
í [age] is a value in days, and defaults to 30.
í [age] == 0 requests all lists.
í Lists from non-existent nodes are automatically purged.

	FTS'er can be run from any location on the SAME DRIVE AS THE BBS.
	If there is a need to switch drives and you want to code it, send
	me a copy so I can re-release it, or you can ask nicely and I might
	do it.  Maybe.  =)

	FTS'er will find the appropriate filelist directory from FDLFTS.CFG
	in the filenet directory *YOU SPECIFY*.  GIGO, people, GIGO.

	FTS does not check to see if it has already requested a list.  So if
	you run it twenty times a day with the -a switch, you'll request every
	missing list twenty times a day.  If you set [age] to 1 each time, 
	you're going to be requesting a *lot* of lists.
