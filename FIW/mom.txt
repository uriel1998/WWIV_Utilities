But, you  can only have one main routine in any program executable...
Also, nargs is the number of arguments being passed (+1), with the
first argument  being the name of the program itself...So, you'll have to
do some recoding - at least to rename main to something else.

What you really have here is an array of pointers to character strings
(with the pointers being implicitly created for the strings in double
quotes.

It would help if you had included the error, but here are a couple of
thoughts.

if you are calling the routine for mime, say you've renamed the
subroutine itself
to mime, then you would call it by
     mime (2, argu);

Also, it may be that it is being picky about all the conversion it is
doing for name...

if you have    char name[25];
then the compiler may be happier if you also have,

char *myptr;

myptr=name;

That is, declare a pointer to a character string, assign it the address
of name, and
then use myptr in the values for argu.

A tip - just include the declaration of argu in the program (comment out
the
calls to the mime stuff, and the mime function prototype and see if the
compiler complains about the declaration (other than telling you that it
is not used)- if it passes this, then put back in the prototype for the
mime function, try to compile that, and
finally , put the call back in.

Include some error messages if possible if you need more help.
